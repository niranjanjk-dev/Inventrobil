# 🛠️ Plumbing & Electronics Shop Management System

## Overview
This is a robust, web-based application designed to streamline operations for plumbing and electronics retail shops. It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing inventory, processing sales (billing), and tracking financial performance.

The system is built to be **scalable**, **user-friendly**, and efficient, minimizing manual data entry for shop owners and staff.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📦 Inventory Management
* **Real-time Tracking:** Monitor stock levels for thousands of items (pipes, wires, switches, etc.).
* **Low Stock Alerts:** Automatic notifications when items need restocking.
* **Category Management:** Organize products by type (Plumbing vs. Electronics).

### 2. 🖼️ Smart Auto-Image Fetching
* **Dual Mode:** Administrators can manually upload product photos.
* **Auto-Fill:** If no image is uploaded, the system automatically searches the web based on the product name and attaches a relevant image to the inventory entry.

### 3. 🧾 Billing & POS (Point of Sale)
* **Fast Checkout:** Quick search and add-to-cart functionality.
* **Auto-Calculation:** Automatically calculates subtotals, taxes (GST), discounts, and grand totals.
* **Invoice Generation:** Generates professional, printable PDF receipts.

### 4. 📊 Analytics & Reporting
* **Sales Dashboard:** View daily and monthly revenue graphs.
* **Profit Tracking:** Calculate profit margins based on cost vs. selling price.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js
* **Frontend:** React.js / HTML5 & Bootstrap
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite
* **Image API:** Google Custom Search API / Bing Search API

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
